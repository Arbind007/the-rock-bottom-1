             This is Ishaan Sharma.
             I am both, a guitarist and a vocalist. 
             Being a lyricist alongside, I sometimes do get myself into poetry to let the voice of my heart out in words. 
             When it comes to being a guitarist, I have been passionate about playing guitar for 4 years and so.
             I love to run my fingers on the guitar strings and make some good music out of it which soothes the soul and sometimes strum to make everyone groove to it.<br>

So about me, I'm a pianist, guitarist, drummer, bassist and beatboxer. How did I get into all this? Simple. I saw someone play something on a keyboard and it fascinated me like anything! It was at that moment I decided to do something similar and here we are with tens of wins, hundreds of competitions and events and contless memories. Well, that was my part and I hope to be able to make a positive difference in this humongous sweet world in some way or the other. Peace!<br>
